# Maze-the-Game
My first game. It's somewhat complete but somewhat buggy as well.
Just a "simple" maze game that was first created for a homework assignment later continued to become an actual thing.


Probably abandoned, but may pick this up later to refine it.

Also I'll upload the old versions when I find them.
