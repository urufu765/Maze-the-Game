# Final thoughts:
"""
I created this code in such a way that I can keep adding onto it without messing up the main code.
This allows me to have different size maps and multiple levels, and maybe even make a new feature.
The hardest part was either starting the code, or the graphic map generator.
Also I learned something very useful: you can indent a block of code by selecting the block and pressing Tab...
it saved more than 20 minutes of work."""
